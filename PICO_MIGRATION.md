## Overview
This document summarizes the migration of the bookmarks application from custom CSS to Pico CSS framework.

## What Was Changed

  - Set semantic HTML structure

### 3. CSS Architecture
- Replaced custom CSS variables with Pico CSS variables
- Updated `global.css` to import Pico CSS and add custom overrides
- Created bookmark-specific utility classes that work with Pico's design system

### 4. Component Updates

- Used native Pico form styling with proper `<fieldset>` organization
- Implemented proper error states with `aria-invalid`

- Improved responsive design with Pico's conventions

#### SearchQueryFilter

### 5. Theme Support

## Custom CSS Overrides

The following custom styles were preserved for bookmark-specific functionality:

.bookmark-number { /* Numbering for bookmark lists */ }
.bookmark-tag { /* Tag styling */ }
.bookmark-domain { /* Domain name styling */ }
.bookmark-description { /* Description text */ }
.bookmark-meta { /* Metadata styling */ }
.bookmark-row { /* Row layout */ }
.btn-compact { /* Compact button variant */ }
.drop-zone { /* Drag-and-drop styling */ }
```
