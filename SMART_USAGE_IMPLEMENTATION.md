# Smart Usage Sorting - Implementation Summary

## What's New

I've implemented a comprehensive **Smart Usage** sorting system for your bookmarks that prioritizes frequently used bookmarks while naturally letting stale ones fall to the bottom as your behavior changes.

## Key Features

### 1. Relevance-Based Algorithm
- **70% weight on clicks**: How often you actually use the bookmark
- **30% weight on recency**: When you last visited it
- **Time decay**: Older visits matter less than recent ones
- **New bookmark boost**: Recently added bookmarks get a 7-day boost to encourage trial use

### 2. Adaptive Behavior
- Bookmarks you use frequently rise to the top
- Bookmarks you haven't visited in months naturally sink down
- The sorting adapts to your changing browsing habits over time
- Never-clicked bookmarks get minimal relevance unless recently added

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
- **Help button** appears next to "Smart Usage" sort option (? icon)
- **Interactive documentation** showing:
  - How the algorithm works with visual explanations
  - Your bookmark collection statistics
  - Examples from your actual bookmarks
  - Comparison with other sorting methods
  - Pro tips for effective usage

## Technical Implementation

### Files Added
- `src/lib/utils/RelevanceUtils.ts` - Core relevance calculation algorithm
- `src/lib/component/BookmarkManager/SortingHelp.svelte` - Comprehensive help component

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/component/BookmarkManager/Logic.ts` - Added smart sorting functions
- `src/lib/component/BookmarkManager/View.svelte` - Integrated smart usage as default, added help UI
- `src/lib/component/SearchQueryFilter/View.svelte` - Fixed filter options interface

### Algorithm Details

```typescript
Relevance Score = (Click Score √ó 70%) + (Recency Score √ó 30%)

Where:
- Click Score = min(clicks √∑ 100, 1.0)
- Recency Score = exponential decay based on days since last visit
- Minimum score = 0.1 (prevents complete irrelevance)
- New item boost = +0.2 for bookmarks less than 7 days old
```

### Time Decay Formula
- **0-30 days**: Gradual exponential decay (stays relevant)
- **30-90 days**: Accelerated decay (becoming stale)
- **90+ days**: Rapid decay (mostly irrelevant unless heavily clicked)
- **Never clicked**: Relies on new item boost, then minimum score

## User Experience

### Default Behavior
- "Smart Usage" is now the default sort option
- Works immediately with existing bookmark click data
- No configuration required

### Help Integration
- Help button (?) appears when "Smart Usage" is selected
- Modal dialog with comprehensive explanation
- Real-time analysis of user's bookmark collection
- Examples using actual user data

### Performance
- Efficient caching of relevance scores
- Optimized for collections of 140+ bookmarks
- Minimal computational overhead
- Maintains responsive UI performance

## Benefits

1. **üéØ Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts to changing browsing habits
2. **‚è∞ Time-Aware**: Recent activity weighs more than old patterns
3. **üßπ Self-Cleaning**: Stale bookmarks naturally sink without manual intervention
4. **üÜï New-Friendly**: Recently added bookmarks get visibility for trial use
5. **üìä Data-Driven**: Based on actual usage patterns, not just click counts

## Testing

Created and ran comprehensive tests showing the algorithm correctly:
- Prioritizes heavily-used recent bookmarks
- Demotes stale bookmarks (not visited in 90+ days)
- Gives new bookmarks a temporary boost
- Handles edge cases (never-clicked, very old bookmarks)

The implementation is ready for immediate use and will improve your daily bookmark browsing experience by surfacing the most relevant bookmarks first while gracefully handling changing usage patterns over time.
